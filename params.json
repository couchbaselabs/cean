{"name":"CEAN","tagline":"Scaffolding for Couchbase + Express + AngularJS + Node.js","body":"# CEAN = /kiÀên/ = Couchbase + Express + AngularJS + Node.js\r\n\r\nThis source code repository contains useful stuff regarding the subject 'Scaffolding modern JavaScript based web applications by using the C(ouchbase) + E(xpress) + A(ngularJS) + N(ode.js) stack'.\r\n\r\nThe CEAN stack is based on the following components:\r\n\r\n* Couchbase Server / Couchbase Node.js module: A highly scalable distributed KV-Store and Document Database System\r\n* Express: A web application framework for Node.js\r\n* AngularJS: A client side JavaScript MVC web application framework\r\n* Node.js: A JavaScript oriented web service/application platform which is designed to build scalable network application\r\n\r\nThe tooling is based on:\r\n\r\n* YEOMAN: The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps\r\n* Grunt: The JavaScript Task Runner\r\n* cean-cli: A node module which provides a simplified command line interface on top of YEOMAN (TODO!)\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\n* Install the following on your development machine. For instance for Ubunut 14.04:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install gcc\r\nsudo apt-get make\r\nsudo apt-get nodejs\r\nsudo apt-get nodejs-legacy\r\nsudo apt-get npm\r\nsudo npm install -g yo\r\nsudo npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\n* Clone this repository\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/dmaier-couchbase/cean.git\r\n```\r\n* Change the directory\r\n```\r\ncd cean/src/yeoman-generators/generator-cean\r\n```\r\n* Link the Generator by resolving the deps\r\n```\r\nsudo npm link\r\n```\r\n* Side note: Double check that you have permissions to $HOME/tmp, if not use 'chown' in order to change the owner of this directory!\r\n* Create a new project directory \r\n```\r\ncd --\r\nmkdir myapp\r\n```\r\n* Scaffold a new Couchbase application\r\n```\r\nyo cean myapp\r\n```\r\n* Answer the questions regarding 'Couchbase Host', 'Couchbase Bucket', 'Couchbase Password'! Please also make sure that the bucket is existent and accessible with this password. For instance:\r\n```\r\n== This is the Couchbase CEAN generator ==\r\nappname = myapp\r\n[?] Your Couchbase Host: 192.168.7.160\r\n192.168.7.160\r\n[?] Your Couchbase Bucket: cean\r\ncean\r\n[?] Your Couchbase Bucket Password: test\r\ntest\r\n...\r\n```\r\n* Wait until all dependencies are downloaded!\r\n\r\n* Open the example application in your browser, E.G:\r\n```\r\nhttp://192.168.7.162:9000/\r\n```\r\n* Click on the 'Add Test Document' button\r\n* Also inspect the log output of your application\r\n* If everything worked fine then you get a success message:\r\n```\r\nSuccessfully added a document to your Couchbase bucket!\r\n```\r\n* Reload the page and you should see the just inserted message: \r\n```\r\nHello Couchbase!\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Grunt\r\n\r\nUse Grunt to host the application and enjoy automagically LiveReloaded server and client application when you make changes!\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Sub-Generators\r\n\r\nThe following sub-generators are currently available\r\n\r\n* angular-controller: Adds an Angular controller to your project\r\n* angular-view: Adds an angular view to your project\r\n* angular-route: Adds a route by glueing the controller and the view together\r\n\r\nHere an example which adds a controller which is named 'TestCtrl' to the application called 'myapp'. In the next step a new view with the name 'test' is created. Afterwards a route is added in order to make sure that the test controller is used together with the test view.\r\n\r\n```\r\nyo cean:angular-controller TestCtrl myapp\r\nyo cean:angular-view test\r\nyo cean:angular-route test.html TestCtrl\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportant: Files have CEAN markers in them in order to make this work. Markers are realized as source code comments. So you should not remove something like '--cean: ${Marker}' in your source code. This would basically break some sub-generator funtionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/dmaier-couchbase/cean/master/assets/screen.png)\r\n\r\n# TODO-s\r\n\r\nPlease have a look here: https://github.com/dmaier-couchbase/cean/issues\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
